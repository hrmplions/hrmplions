          RULES, WARRANTIES, AND GENERAL PROVISIONS

        <ul class="space-y-1 text-gray-700 list-disc list-outside ml-8">
          <li>
            As used in this agreement, the Club, You, and Your refers to the
            High Rolls Mountain Park Lions Club and its membership in entirety.
            The pronouns I, Me, and My as well as the term the Vendor refers to
            individuals, partnerships, corporation, organizations, and any
            combination of the aforementioned, or any other means of business
            wishing to contract booth space for the purpose of selling or
            otherwise distributing goods and/or services during either of the
            Club`s two annual festivals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contract refers to the mutually agreed upon terms of both the Club
            and the Vendor effective the date this agreement is received by the
            Club appropriately signed and approved by the Vendor, and payment is
            received and clears the bank account of the Club.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="mt-8">General provisions:</h4>
        <ul class="space-y-1 text-gray-700 list-disc list-outside ml-8">
          <li>
            I am aware and understand that booth spaces are approximately ten
            (10) feet by ten (10) feet in dimension, and are assigned on a
            first-come, first-served basis, with a preferential choice given to
            returning vendors who rented a booth at the last festival. I realize
            there is no guarantee that the space I am assigned will be even and
            level or that it will be sheltered by trees. I understand that I am
            responsible for providing tables, chairs, tents, and/or any other
            applicable equipment and/or tools required for the conduct of my
            business at the festival. I also understand that there is no
            electricity, telephone, water, or any other utility provided to my
            assigned booth space(s), and should I require any such utility, it
            is my responsibility to procure said requirements in accordance with
            any applicable restrictions or laws.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since security is not provided by the Club, I agree to secure my
            area, money and/or valuable merchandise against theft and/or
            vandalism and relieve the Club of responsibility from any such acts.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it is the nature of my business to sell art and/or craft type
            items, I agree that the items I sell will be original works of my
            own or of an individual or entity that I represent.
            <strong
              >I may only use kit-built or store-bought items to enhance my
              products.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            If it is the nature of my business to sell food for on-site
            consumption, I will post my food handler`s permit and my food vendor
            permit where they are visible to customers at my booth.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I require a generator for power for my booth, I agree that I will
            place it where the noise will be muffled from customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Club reserves the right to deny the distribution or display of
            any item(s) deemed inappropriate and I fully agree to discontinue
            presentation of said item(s) upon request.
          </li>
          <li>
            I agree that I will not sell items for on-premises human
            consumption, and that if it is in the nature of my business, I will
            obey all applicable health and safety requirements concerning the
            sale of items for off-premises human consumption.
          </li>
          <li>
            I agree, to the best of my ability, that I will complete the set-up
            of my assigned booth space prior to the festival and avoid set-up or
            tear-down activities during festival hours.
            <strong
              >Immediately after unloading any necessary items for the conduct
              of my business I AGREE THAT I WILL MOVE MY VEHICLE FROM THE MAIN
              PARKING AREA.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I AGREE THAT I WILL NOT BRING PETS TO THE FESTIVAL.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            I agree to haul my trash and empty boxes to the dumpster on the east
            side of the main building.
          </li>
          <li>
            The vendor areas of the festival are located on private property
            wholly owned by the High Rolls Lions Club. I agree that I am a guest
            on this property and will treat the members of the High Rolls Lions
            and all other guests respectfully and with the same courtesy as I
            would expect of anyone in my own home. Furthermore, I agree that
            permission to remain on the property can be withdrawn at any time
            and that my failure to vacate from the premises if requested to do
            so will be considered a violation of New Mexico statute 30-14-1
            regarding criminal trespass.
          </li>

        <h4 class="mt-8">Insurance:</h4>
        <ul class="space-y-1 text-gray-700 list-disc list-outside ml-8">
          <li>
            Concerning my presence at the festival, I am responsible for my
            safety and the safety of others conducting business or otherwise
            visiting my assigned booth space. I agree to indemnify the Club and
            its parent organization, The International Organization of Lions
            Clubs from claims by assuming full financial responsibility, insured
            or otherwise, should I, the Club, another Vendor, or any other
            individual or party be injured or killed as a result of my actions
            or presence, to include the sale or distribution of defective or
            harmful products and/or materials.

        <ul class="space-y-1 text-gray-700 list-disc list-outside ml-8">
          <li>
            I agree that the required fee for contracting booth space must be
            received by the Club, prior to the festival, before I will be
            permitted to enter the vendor area with the intent to display, sell,
            or otherwise distribute goods and/or services, or for the purpose of
            conducting any other business on or in the vicinity of the festival
            grounds. I further agree to pay a service charge of $25.00 in
            addition to bank fees should my draft (check, or money order) be
            returned unpaid, as well as any collection and/or attorney fees paid
            by the Club in an attempt to recover all or part of my outstanding
            financial obligation.

            festival for any reason.

          <li>
            Although the Club can provide indications of attendance at previous
            festivals, I agree that no guarantee can or will be made concerning
            expected attendance and/or profit and that I will not hold the Club
            liable for any losses that I may sustain during the festival.

            These contract provisions are for one entire festival. Although I am
            not required to attend and conduct business for the entire duration,
            I agree that no refund is provided should I choose or am otherwise
            prevented from doing so.
          </li>
          <li>
            I agree that if I am expelled from the festival for any reason, to
            include but not be limited to failure to comply with the terms of
            this agreement, I am not entitled to a refund.
          </li>
          <li>
            I understand that the Club provides no refund and no alternate date
            for the festival should there be inclement weather.

          <li>
            If I cancel before the first day of the month of the festival, a
            full refund will be provided to me, but no refund will be provided
            after that.

          <li>
            I may re-assign, sublet, or share my space with the approval of the
            Club, provided that the vendor accepting, subletting, or sharing my
            assigned space is willing to also accept the terms of this agreement
            and contract separately with the Club.
